  (O'Reilly book) ``Python for Data Analysis is concerned with the
  nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching
  data in Python. It is also a practical, modern introduction to
  scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive
  applications. This is a book about the parts of the Python language
  and libraries youâ€™ll need to effectively solve a broad set of data
  analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical
  methods using Python as the implementation language.''
