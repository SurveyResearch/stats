\chapter{Introduction}

What is statistics\footnote{test note}?

\epigraph{Modern statistics provides a quantitative technology for
  empirical science; it is a logic and methodology for the measurement
  of uncertainty and for an examination of the consequences of that
  uncertainty in the planning and interpretation of experimentation
  and observation.}{\citet{stigler_history_1986}}

\epigraph{If all sciences require measurement--and statistics is the
  logic of measurement--it follows that the history of statistics can
  encompass the history of all of
  science.}{\citet{stigler_history_1986}}

\part{Philosophy}

\begin{remark}
  Relevance of philosophy to stats?  Bridge between mathematics and world.
\end{remark}

Radical empricism: data first, then theory.

Rationalism: theory, then data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Causality}

\begin{remark}
  Factor analysis - factor = causal factor
\end{remark}

\part{Science}

Science originally ``natural philosophy''.

\begin{remark}
  Science and scientism, pseudo-science, cargo-cult science.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Scientific method - ties philosophy to experience.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  On the relationship between mathematics and the world.  Involving
  fundamental philosophical ideas, also pragmatics of \textit{doing}
  ``science''.

  The fundamental issue is what sorts of claims can statistics make
  about the world, how should we take them, etc.  The goal here is of
  course clarity.

  This is the natural place for a historical perspective, as well.
  How did statistical practice (and theory) evolve?
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Stress: empiricism as a philosophy did not pan out - we are not mere
  observers of given data.
\end{remark}

Paradigmatic cases?  Astronomical observations; invention/discovery of
quantifiable temperature, psychometrics, etc.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Measurement and Error}

\begin{remark}
  The previous section discuss the mathematical concept of measure.
  This section discusses theories of empirical measure\textit{ment}.

\part{A Statistical Beastiary}

Specific statistics, distribs, tests, etc. - how they are used in practice.

\chapter{Chi Squared}
\label{sect:chisquared}

To find the expected multiplicities, form the disjoint union of the marginals.

\begin{remark}
  Not sure ``disjoint union'' is the right term.  The idea is that we
  take the observed marginals, say A and X, and form the set of all
  pairs (a,x) by multiplying.  Effectively this means we take all
  observed pairs (a,\_) and (\_,x), ignore the second and first
  members, respectively, and then ``cross'' them.  So for every (a,\_)
  we get X copies of (a,x), one for each (\_,x).  The result has
  multiplicity of \(A\times X\).  I think this is disjoint union but
  I'm not sure.
\end{remark}
