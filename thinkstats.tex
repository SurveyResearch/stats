\chapter{Sets `n Stuff}

We use the Z Specification notation \cite{z-iso-13568}.

\begin{description}
\item [Sets] Membership, subset; family of sets
\item [Relations]
\item [Functions]
\item [Sequences]
\item [Multisets]
\end{description}

%%%%
\section{Sets}

Notation: extension v. comprehension


%%%%
\section{Relations}

%%%%
\section{Functions}


\subsection{Definition}

\begin{description}
\item [Function] Informally, a function is a set of ordered pairs.
  The Z specification says ``A function is a particular form of
  relation, where each domain element has only one corresponding range
  element.''\cite{z-iso-13568}%p [9]
\item [Function Extension] Since a function is a kind of set, it can
  be defined by explicitly listing its extension--all of its elements.
  For example, the function $f$ that maps each integer between $1$ and
  $3$ to itself can be expressed by writing out the complete list of
  its elements: ${f=\{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)\}}$.
\item [Function Comprehension] A second way of defining a function is
  to express the ``rule'' that determines the elements it contains,
  without listing them explicitly.  For example ``the function that
  maps every number to itself'' defines the identity function.  Z provides
  two ways of doing this, one using standard set comprehension
  notation, the other using ``function construction'' notation.  See
  below.
\end{description}

\subsection{Notation}

The Z notation supports several ways of representing a function.  A
function extension expression may use ordered pair notation or maplet
notation.  The following example illustrates two ways to define the
function that maps each integer between $1$ and $3$, inclusive, to its
double.

\begin{alignat}{2}
  f &= \{(1,2),(2,4),(3,6)\} \\
  &= \{1\mapsto 2, 2\mapsto 4, 3\mapsto 6\}
\end{alignat}

\noindent More generally:

\begin{alignat}{2}
  \langle e_1,\ldots e_n\rangle &= \{(1,e_1),\ldots (3,e_n)\} \\
  &= \{1\mapsto e_1,\ldots 3\mapsto e_n\}
\end{alignat}

Z also supports two ways to define a function intensionally -- in
terms of a property rather than an explicit list of elements.

\begin{remark}
FIXME: set comprehension expression for functions:
\begin{alignat}{2}
  f &= \{x,y | y=2x @ (x,y)\} \\
  &= \{x,y | y=2x @ x\mapsto y\}
\end{alignat}
\end{remark}

\textit{Function construction} notation...
\begin{alignat}{2}
  f &= \{\lambda
\end{alignat}


%%%%
\section{Sequences}
\label{subs:sequences}

\begin{remark}
  Lay down the basic concepts, terminology, and notation, for later
  use in discussing sampling, etc.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Definition}

\begin{description}
\item [Sequence] Informally, a sequence is an ordered set.  The Z
  specification says ``A sequence is a particular form of function,
  where the domain elements are all the natural numbers from 1 to the
  length of the sequence.''
\end{description}

\subsection{Notation}

The Z notation uses angle brackets to form a sequence expression:

\begin{alignat}{2}
  \langle e_1,\ldots e_n\rangle &= \{(1,e_1),\ldots (3,e_n)\} \\
  &= \{1\mapsto e_1,\ldots 3\mapsto e_n\}
\end{alignat}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Multisets}

We follow \citet{singh_overview_2007}, with some modifications.

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{description}
\item [Multiset]
\item [Element]
\item [Carrier]  The carrier of an mset is the set from which its elements is drawn.
\item [Generator]  The generators of an mset are the elements of its carrier set.
\item [Multiplcity]  The multiplicity of an element of an mset is the number of times it ``occurs'' (``appears'', etc.).
\item [Cardinality] The cardinality (size) of an mset is the sum of
  the multiplicities of its elements.  The cardinality of the carrier of an mset is the number of elements it contains.
\end{description}

\subsection{Notation}

The mset containing one $a$, two $b$, and three $c$

\begin{equation}
  M = \{(a,1), (b,2), (c, 3)\}
\end{equation}

\noindent can be written as follows:

\begin{description}
\item [Multiplicative notation]  The following are equivalent:

\begin{itemize}
\item $[[a,b,b,c,c,c]]$
\item $[a,b,b,c,c,c]$
\item $[a,b,c]_{1,2,3}$
\item $[a^1,b^2,c^3]$
\item $[a1,b2,c3]$
\end{itemize}

Note order is irrelevant.

\item [Linear notation]  The following are equivalent:

\begin{itemize}
\item $[a]+2[b]+3[c]$
\item $\{[a],2[b],3[c]\}$ Note that this style combines multiplicative
  notation for mset elements with standard set notation ($\{\ldots\}$)
  for the mset itself.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

One advantage of the linear notation is that it allows us to have
non-integral and non-positive multiplicities; for example, in
$\{[a],-0.5[b],\pi[c]\}$ element $a$ occurs once, $b$ occurs $-0.5$
times, and $c$ occurs $\pi$ times.

In addition, linear notation allows a concise variant somewhat like a
stem-and-leaf display:

$$\{[a],2[b],2[c],3[d]\} = \{1[a], 2[b,c], 3[c]\}$$

%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Stem and Leaf}

Multisets can be represented using stem-and-leaf tables:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Multisequences}

A multiset is a set of ordered pairs, and is therefore unordered.
Just as we can extend the concept of set to form a sequence, we can
extend the notion of multiset to form a multisequence.

\begin{description}
\item [Multisequence]  A multisequence is a sequence of multiset elements.
\end{description}

We use the same angle bracket notation we use for set sequences:

\begin{alignat}{2}
  \langle [a],2[b],3[c]\rangle &= \{(1, (a,1)), (2,(b,2)), (3,(3,c))\} \\
  &= \{1\mapsto (a,1), 2\mapsto (b,2), 3\mapsto (3,c)\} \\
  &= \langle a,b,b,c,c,c\rangle
\end{alignat}

Since multisets are unordered, we have

\begin{equation}
  \{[a],2[b],3[c]\} = \{2[b],[a],3[c]\} = \{3[c],2[b],[a]\} = \ldots
\end{equation}

Multisequences are ordered, so for example

\begin{equation}
  \langle [a],2[b],3[c]\rangle \neq \langle2[b],[a],3[c]\rangle
\end{equation}

\noindent since

\begin{equation}
  \{(1,(a,2), (2,(b,2), (3,(c,3)\}\neq \{(1,(b,2)), (2,(a,2)), (3,(c,3))\}
\end{equation}

\noindent alternatively

\begin{equation}
  \{(1\mapsto (a,2), 2\mapsto (b,2), 3\mapsto (c,3)\} 
  \neq \{(1\mapsto (b,2)), 2\mapsto (a,2)), 3\mapsto (c,3))\}
\end{equation}

Also:  $\langle a,b,b,c,c,c\rangle \neq [a,b,b,c,c,c]$

\chapter{Counting and Combining}

\cite{berge_principles_1971}

What is combinatorics?

\blockquote{Combinatorics can rightly be called the mathematics of counting. More speciﬁcally, it
is the mathematics of the enumeration, existence, construction, and optimization questions
concerning ﬁnite sets. (Mazur, guided tour)}

\blockquote{The concept of configuration can be made mathematically precise by defining it as a mapping of a set of objects into a finite abstract set with a given structure; for example, a permutation of n objects is a “bijection of the set of n objects into the ordered set 1, 2, ..., n.” Nevertheless, one is only interested in mappings satisfying certain constraints.

Just as arithmetic deals with integers (with the standard operations), algebra deals with operations in general, analysis deals with functions, geometry deals with rigid shapes, and topology deals with continuity, so does combinatorics deal with configurations. Combinatorics counts, enu- merates,* examines, and investigates the existence of configurations with certain specified properties.
}

\section{Counting Principles}

\begin{remark}
  Most of these are just restatements of basic arithmetic, expressed
  in terms of doing things.  Why bother?  I suspect that thinking in
  terms of sequences of actions makes it easier to do combinatorics.
  Also, these ideas only seem to be articulated as principles in
  elementary texts for e.g. high school algebra.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  But isn't combinatorics just the science of counting?
\end{remark}

\begin{principle}[Fundamental Principle of Counting]

\end{principle}

\begin{description}
\item [Principle of addition]: if there are $a$ ways of doing one thing
  and $b$ ways of doing another, and we cannot do both, then there are
  $a+b$ ways to choose one thing to do.  This is just a restatement of
  a set-theoretic definition of addition in terms of union of sets.

  In combinatoric texts something like this is more typical:

  \textit{Addition Rule}. If $A$ and $B$ are finite, disjoint sets,
  then $A \cup B$ is finite and $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$.

\item [Principle of multiplication]: if there are $a$ ways of doing
  one thing and $b$ ways of doing another, then there are $a\cdot b$
  ways of doing both.  This is a restatement of a set-theoretic
  definition of addition in terms of cartesian products.
\end{description}

\chapter{Computability and Decideability}

\begin{remark}
  Why important for intro to stats?  Mainly for historical reasons;
  both effective procedure and axiom of choice emerged at roughly the
  same time.  Also, an understanding of effective proc sharpens
  understanding of choice and randomness.
\end{remark}

\section{Effective Procedure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Choice and Chance}

\section{The Axiom of Choice}

The Axiom of Choice is of enormous important in mathematics generally.
Statistics is no exception; the significance of the axiom will become
especially apparent when we discuss the concept of random sample.

\blockquote{The principle of set theory known as the Axiom of Choice has been hailed as “probably the most interesting and, in spite of its late appearance, the most discussed axiom of mathematics, second only to Euclid's axiom of parallels which was introduced more than two thousand years ago” (Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel \& Levy 1973, §II.4).  The fulsomeness (\textit{sic}) of this description might lead those unfamiliar with the axiom to expect it to be as startling as, say, the Principle of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light or the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. But in fact the Axiom of Choice as it is usually stated appears humdrum, even self-evident. For it amounts to nothing more than the claim that, given any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set — a transversal or choice set — containing exactly one element from each member of the given collection. Nevertheless, this seemingly innocuous principle has far-reaching mathematical consequences — many indispensable, some startling — and has come to figure prominently in discussions on the foundations of mathematics. It (or its equivalents) have been employed in countless mathematical papers, and a number of monographs have been exclusively devoted to it.\cite{bell_axiom_2013}}

Often stated in terms of choice functions.

Variants:

AC1: 
Any collection of nonempty sets has a choice function.''

AC2: 
Any indexed collection of sets has a choice function.

Or relations:

\begin{axiom}[Axiom of Choice]
\label{ax:choice}
For every family $\mathcal{F}$ of nonempty disjoint sets there exists
a \textit{selector}, that is, a set $S$ that intersects every $F\in
\mathcal{F}$ in precisely one point.\cite{ciesielski_set_1997}
\end{axiom}

Transversal:  In a 1908 paper Zermelo introduced a modified form of AC. Let us call a transversal (or choice set) for a family of sets H any subset T ⊆ ∪H for which each intersection T ∩ X for X ∈ H has exactly one element.  As a very simple example, let H = {{0}, {1}, {2, 3}}. Then H has the two transversals {0, 1, 2} and {0, 1, 3}. A more substantial example is afforded by letting H be the collection of all lines in the Euclidean plane parallel to the x-axis. Then the set T of points on the y-axis is a transversal for H.

So we have choice functions and choice sets.


``Let us call Zermelo's 1908 formulation the combinatorial axiom of choice:

CAC: 
Any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a transversal.'' (bell)


The problem:


\blockquote{It is to be noted that AC1 and CAC for finite collections
  of sets are both provable (by induction) in the usual set
  theories. But in the case of an infinite collection, even when each
  of its members is finite, the question of the existence of a choice
  function or a transversal is problematic[4]. For example, as already
  mentioned, it is easy to come up with a choice function for the
  collection of pairs of real numbers (simply choose the smaller
  element of each pair). But it is by no means obvious how to produce
  a choice function for the collection of pairs of arbitrary sets of
  real numbers.\cite{bell_axiom_2013}}

Footnote: 
\blockquote{The difficulty here is amusingly illustrated by an anecdote due to Bertrand Russell. A millionaire possesses an infinite number of pairs of shoes, and an infinite number of pairs of socks. One day, in a fit of eccentricity, the millionaire summons his valet and asks him to select one shoe from each pair. When the valet, accustomed to receiving precise instructions, asks for details as to how to perform the selection, the millionaire suggests that the left shoe be chosen from each pair. Next day the millionaire proposes to the valet that he select one sock from each pair. When asked as to how this operation is to be carried out, the millionaire is at a loss for a reply, since, unlike shoes, there is no intrinsic way of distinguishing one sock of a pair from the other. In other words, the selection of the socks must be truly arbitrary.}

The axiom of choice and probability (randomness) are different
concepts.  See
http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/29381/picking-from-an-uncountable-set-axiom-of-choice

\section{Chance and Randomness}

See \cite{eagle_chance_2014}

Indeterminacy, disorder, chaos, stochastic process, etc.

chance of a process, randomness of its product

Chance: physical; randomness: mathematical?

``It is safest, therefore, to conclude that chance and randomness, while they overlap in many cases, are separate concepts.''\cite{eagle_chance_2014}

Process v. Product concepts

``Of course the terminology in common usage is somewhat slippery; it's not clear, for example, whether to count random sampling as a product notion, because of the connection with randomness, or as a process notion, because sampling is a process.''

\blockquote{The upshot of this discussion is that chance is a process notion, rather than being entirely determined by features of the outcome to which the surface grammar of chance ascriptions assigns the chance. For if there can be a single-case chance of ½ for a coin to land heads on a toss even if there is only one actual toss, and it lands tails, then surely the chance cannot be fixed by properties of the outcome ‘lands heads’, as that outcome does not exist.[2] The chance must rather grounded in features of the process that can produce the outcome: the coin-tossing trial, including the mass distribution of the coin and the details of how it is tossed, in this case, plus the background conditions and laws that govern the trial. Whether or not an event happens by chance is a feature of the process that produced it, not the event itself.\cite{eagle_chance_2014}}

\blockquote{a process conception of randomness makes nonsense of some obvious uses of ‘random’ to characterise an entire collection of outcomes of a given repeated process. This is the sense in which a random sample is random: it is an unbiased representation of the population from which it is drawn—and that is a property of the entire sample, not each individual member. While many random samples will be drawn using a random process, they need not be....To be sure that our sample is random, we may wish to use random numbers to decide whether to include a given individual in the sample; to that end, large tables of random digits have been produced, displaying no order or pattern (RAND Corporation 1955). This other conception of randomness, as attaching primarily to collections of outcomes, has been termed product randomness.(eagle)}

\blockquote{If the actual process that generate the sequences are perfectly deterministic, it may be that a typical product of that process is not random. But we are rather concerned to characterise which of all the possible sequences produced by any process whatsoever are random, and it seems clear that most of the ways an infinite sequence might be produced, and hence most of the sequences so produced, will be random.(eagle)}

...concentrate on the sequence of outcomes as independently given mathematical entities, rather than as the products of a large number of independent Bernoulli trials...


Goal: devise mathematics to ``capture the intuitive notion of randomness.''

Compare logicians' attempts to capture the intuitive notion of logical consequence.

 Howson and Urbach (1993: 324) that ‘it seems highly doubtful that there is anything like a unique notion of randomness there to be explicated’.

Intuitions about randomness:

\begin{itemize}
\item a property of a sequence
\item indeterminism
\item epistemic randomness
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Measure and Integration}

\begin{remark}
  Why this?  Mainly just as a notational convenience.  Even if we target an
  audience with minimal math, it is useful to have $\int$ (or
  $\overset{+}{\lambda}$) to indicate the area under a curve.  And
  that is critical to the concept of probability of a continuous
  random variable, which is one of the main concepts we want to get
  across.

  Furthermore the basic concepts are not that difficult:
  differentiation as the limit of a ratio of differences, integration
  is the limit of a sum of products.  The details of how one might
  actually do this may be daunting for many readers, but the basic
  concepts are quite simple and intuitive.  Especially with lambda
  notation.

\begin{remark}
  What about differentiation?

\chapter{Thinking Exponentially (and Logarithmically)}

\begin{remark}
  Task 1: convince reader that exp and log, power and root, are
  special.  Task 2: Provide intuitive, clear, simple explanation.
  Task three: show relation to stats thinking.
\end{remark}

Learning to think in terms of exponents and logarithms is one of the
keys to learning to think statistically.  Fortunately it's not too
difficult, and it happens to be fascinating.

Getting from here to there.  We normally think linearly.  The number
line is treated as additive; to get from $a$ to $b$ on the number
line, you add the (possibly negative) difference between the two: $a +
(a-b) = b$.

Exponentiation offers a different way of thinking about the relation
between two numbers.  Instead of viewing their difference as spatial
distance ($a-b$), we think of it in terms of difference in growth.  So
the difference between, say, $3$ and $9$ is not $6 (= |3-9|)$, but $2
(= log_3\ 9)$.  Here we take $2$ as the number of (natural) growth
cycles it takes for $3$ to turn into $9$: $3^2 = 9$.

Why \textit{growth}?  Because exponentiation is self-contained, so to
speak.  Getting from $3$ to $9$ linearly involves adding something
external ($6$) to $3$.  But $3^2$ does not involve any external
``factor'' in this way (other than the multiplication operation); the
difference between $3$ and $9$ is construed in terms of $3$ alone;
``raising $3$ to a power'' is construed as an operation involving $3$
alone.  The task is to find how many times this something must be done
for $3$ to ``turn into'' (rather than ``arrive at'') $9$.

Traditional terminology (now archaic) captured this; as late as the
19th century, a common term for exponentiation was ``involution'',
meaning something like ``turning in to itself''.

Note that conventional terminology, being derived from Greek geometry
($3^2$ means ``three \textit{squared}''), is misleading.
Exponentiation has nothing essential to do with geometry.  (And note
that the Greeks did not have a genuine concept of exponentiation; they
never came up with the kind of algebraic thinking involved in finding
powers and roots.)  The Arabic-speaking mathematician who is credited
with inventing algebra in something like the form we know it today
(Al-Khawarizmi) did not use the term ``squared''; his (Arabic) word
for what we call a squared quantity was \textit{m\^{a}l}, meaning
``cattle, stock, wealth''.  Furthermore, the Arabic term for
multiplication was also conceptually distinct from the notion of
repeated ``folding'' (``multiply'' comes from the latin
\textit{multiplicare}, combining \textit{multi} ``many times'' and
\textit{plicare}, from \textit{plex} ``fold'').  The Arabic term was
\textit{darb}, ``strike'', and to form a \textit{m\^{a}l}, one
``strikes'' a number \textit{in itself}.  The origins of this usage
are not known, but note that the same term is used in minting
(``strike a coin'') and husbandry (``strike'' was used to refer to
copulation of e.g. livestock).  So historically, exponentiation was
did not emerge from either arithmetic nor geometry; rather, it emerged
as a distinctive concept.

But exponentiation is also conceptually distinct even (or especially)
in modern mathematics.  A satisfactory definition of exponentiation
requires some fairly advanced calculus; the simple concept of
something multiplied by itself is not sufficient.

It even shows up in very practical matters.  Calculation of compound
interest turns out to be intimately related to exponentiation, for
example.

\begin{remark}
  Story of $e$ as discovery of a mathematically satisfying account of
  exponentiation.  Exponentiation defined in terms of logarithms,
  rather than the other way around.
\end{remark}

The critical point of all this is that we should think of
exponentiation as a special kind of operation, rather than as
something derived from arithmetic (multiplication).  Fortunately this
is not particularly difficult, but it does require a basic change in
perspective.

The payoff will come when we consider probability distributions, in
which exponentiation plays a critical role.

\begin{remark}
  Also logarithmic scales, logit, etc.  Lots of places where logs and
  exponents are critical.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Exponentiation as involution.  Inflection points.  Symmetry.
  Constructing the numbers from exponentiation ($\lim_{x \to 0}e^x =
  0$).
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Powers and roots v. exponentiation.  Difference between ${f(x) =
    x^a}$ (powers) and ${f(x)= a^x}$ (exponentiation).
\end{remark}

Sequences: any term of the following sequences can be used to form a
function, e.g. $f(x) = x^2, g(x) = 2^x$.

{\setstretch{1.25}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    x^0, x^1, x^2,..,x^e,\ldots,x^n & \quad \textnormal{Power (geometric) sequence} \\
    0^x, 1^x, 2^x,..,e^x,\ldots,n^x & \quad \textnormal{Exponential sequence}
  \end{alignat}
}

\section{Powers and Roots}

\begin{remark}
  Powers and roots as ``phases'' (``poles'', polarity?) of
  exponentiation, with $1$ as the ``inflection point''.  But we need a
  different term, ``inflection point'' should be reserved for changes
  in the derivative of a curve.  We want something that indicates a
  phase shift, where powers switch to roots and vice-versa.  ``Phase''
  by analogy to phases of matter (solid, liquid, gas), not of cycles
  (waves).  I.e. qualitative change, not cyclic orientation.  Critical
  point? (Freezing point, melting point, etc.)
\end{remark}

This can best be explained by example.

Let's review some basic rules:

{\setstretch{1.25}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    a^{b} &= a\cdot a\cdots a \quad \textnormal{(b times)} \\
    a^{-b} &= \frac{1}{b} \\
    a^{1/b} &= \sqrt[b]{a} \\
    a^{b/c} &= \sqrt[c]{a^b}
  \end{alignat}
}

First powers.  Conventionally, the expression $a^b$ tells us to
multiply $a$ by itself $b$ times (that is, $b-1$ multipication
operations involving $b$ terms $1$).  This makes perfect sense, if $b$
is a whole number and $b>1$.  But what about, say, $a^{1.5}$?  Or even
worse, $a^\pi$?  As it happens, it is fairly easy (but perhaps not
trivial) to define $a^b$ for all rational $b$ (like $1.5$), but
defining it for irrational $b$ (like $\pi$) is another matter.
Explaining how this is done is beyond the scope of this paper, so for
our purposes let's just assume that $a^b$ is defined for all real $b$.

So $a^{1.5}$ and $a^\pi$ are defined, but what does it mean to
multiple $a$ by itself $1.5$ or $\pi$ times?  Not very intuitive.  One
strike against the conventional explanation of exponentiation in terms
of multiplication.

For now, though, let's stick with the multiplication idea. The point
here is that we can treat $a^b$ as a problem to be solved, or a task
to be accomplished: find $c$ such that $a^b = c$.  Let's look at the
structure of the task.  We are given two operands, $a$ and $b$, and an
operation (exponentiation); the task is to find out where these lead
us.  In other words, we do not know where we are going to end up, but
we know how to get there: by raising $a$ to the $b$th power.  In
brief, our task is to reach the destination, given the means of
getting there.

Now consider roots.  The expression $\sqrt[b]{a}$, unlike $a^b$, tells
us where we are to end up, but does not tell us how to get there.
``Find the $b$th power of $a$ means ``perform the exponent operation
$b$ times on $a$; it tells us what to do; but ``find the square root
of $a$'' does not mean ``perform the square root operation on $a$'';
it tells us what the destination is, but not what we need to do to get
there.  In other words, $\sqrt[b]{a}$ denotes a value related to $a$
and $b$, not an operation that uses $a$ and $b$; in contrast, $a^b$,
although it indirectly denotes the destination value, directly denotes
the operation to use to get there.

\begin{remark}
  Improve this.  Both can be viewed as denoting either a value, a
  process, a device, or all of the above.  Why not think of
  $\sqrt[b]{a}$ as denoting an operation?  Mainly because there is no
  such operation, or at least it isn't normally understood in that
  way.  Clearly in contrast to $a^b$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Correction: $a^b$ only \textit{seems} to tell us what to do, because
  it does so in the case of integer exponents.  But in the case of
  real exponents, it precisely does \textit{not} tell us what to do.
  But this is evidence of the specialness of exponentiation.  The
  arithmetic operators do tell us what to do; that is how they are
  defined.  But we \textit{cannot} define exp and root in this way.
  In fact the best we can do is find a procedure for approximating the
  value.

  Alternatively: arithmetic ops defined via effective procedures.  Exp
  ops defined in terms of meaning, not procedure.  There may be many
  distinct procedures that can be used to solve them.

  This is obvious in the case of square root.  Easy to define, but I
  would guess even relatively well-educated people would not know how
  to go about computing a square root by hand.  There are dozens of
  methods for computing square roots, all of which (?) only
  approximate the answer.

  Ditto for the trig funcs.  Easy to provide a geometric definition,
  hard to say how to compute.  Well, semi-hard, not as hard as exp and
  log.

\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
  Put this in a graph: Here's another symmetry: given $b>1$, as $b$
  increases, $a^b$ decreases if $0<|a|<1$, but $a^b$ increases if
  $|a|>1$; if $a=0$, then $a^b=0$ for all $b$, and if $a=1$, then
  $a^b$ = 1 for all $b$.  So here $a=1$ is a critical point where
  $a^b$ changes direction, so to speak, and $a=0$ is a critical point
  - call it a ``constant point'' where $a^b$ is constant.

\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Family of functions/curves: function and meta-function.  $y=e^x$ is a
function; $y=e^{\alpha\ x}$ is a meta-function.  Better: second-order function.

Use lambda abstraction to demonstrate the difference: partial
application of a second-order function yields a first-order function.

Terminology: apply higher-order functions to \textit{parameters},
first-order functions to \textit{arguments}.

\section{Equations, Graphs, and Curves}

\begin{remark}
  Ideally, one would be able to instantly visualize the curve upon
  seeing the equation.  But there are many many functions for which
  this is not so easy.  But with a little practice it becomes
  relatively easy to know the basic shape of a curve from a glance at
  its equation.  So one purpose here is training in the art of seeing
  the curve in the equation.  Example: once you understand the
  relation between functions of $e$ and their curves, such as the
  curves of $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$, then it becomes relatively easy to see
  what shape the curve of the Gaussian PDF ought to have.

  Functions of the form $e^n$ are particularly common, where $n$
  itself can be any sort of expression, e.g. $e^{-(x/\lambda)^k}$
  (Weibull pdf).

  Mastering the shape of an equation really means mastering the shapes
  of a family of equations.

  We can show quite clearly what shape a family of functions has by
  using animation to show what happens as the parameters vary.  This
  will both expose the general shape of the (meta) function, and the
  role of the parameters.

``In probability theory and statistics, a central moment is a moment of a probability distribution of a random variable about the random variable's mean; that is, it is the expected value of a specified integer power of the deviation of the random variable from the mean. The various moments form one set of values by which the properties of a probability distribution can be usefully characterised. Central moments are used in preference to ordinary moments, computed in terms of deviations from the mean instead of from the zero, because the higher-order central moments relate only to the spread and shape of the distribution, rather than also to its location.''\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_about_the_mean}

\begin{remark}
  NB analogy between moment of a distrib (a function) and derivative
  of a function.  Nth moment, Nth derivative, etc.

  Moment: expected value of nth involution of deviation (so we could
  generalize, so $y = log_{\bar{X}-\mu} m$ for any m, yielding $m$ as
  the $y^{th}$ moment.

  Compare finding nth derivative, or, given a function, finding the
  nth anti-derivative (integral).

  So why moments?  I suspect they're like derivatives: just as
  derivatives tell us something about the original function, moments
  tell us something about the original distribution (i.e. the random
  var, which is a function).  Or so I would expect, based on nothing
  more than a principle of symmetry.

``In probability theory and statistics, the moment-generating function of a random variable is an alternative specification of its probability distribution.

There are particularly simple results for the moment-generating functions of distributions defined by the weighted sums of random variables. Note, however, that not all random variables have moment-generating functions.''\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function}

reliability engineering.''
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_function#hazard_function}

``Calculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time,
results in the hazard function (also called hazard rate), $h(t)$. This
becomes the instantaneous failure rate as $t$ tends
to zero...A continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a
failure distribution, $F(t)$, which is a cumulative
distribution function that describes the probability of failure (at
least) up to and including time t...''

\section{Continuous}
\subsection{Gauss}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}

But:

\begin{equation}
  e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = \frac{1}{e^\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{e^{\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}}} =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{e^{\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}}}}
\end{equation}

Now set $\mu=0, \sigma=1$.  Then

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = 0.398942
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} =
  e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} =
  \frac{1}{e^\frac{x^2}{2}}
\end{equation}

Then if x=0, we have

\begin{equation}
  e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} =
  \frac{1}{e^\frac{0}{2}} =
  \frac{1}{e^0} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\end{equation}

so when $\mu=0, \sigma=1, x=0$,

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} = 0.398942
\end{equation}

As $x$ grows in either direction from zero, $e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ ...

The turning point is set by $\sigma^2$, since that determines when
$\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}$ pivots about $1$.  As $x$ gets larger beyond that point,
$e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ gets smaller.

Main point: $e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$ never exceeds $1$,
since the exponent is never less than zero, and $e^0=1$. Then for all
$x>0$, $e^x$ gets bigger, so $\frac{1}{e^x}$ will always be $<1$.  So
the product of the two factors will always be less than $0.398942...$
The bell shape comes from the varying rate of change of
$e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$, which reflects the growth curve of
$\frac{1}{e^x}$, which declines relatively rapidly near zero, but
flattens out as $x$ increases.

The key is in the derivatives:

{\setstretch{1.5}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
  \overline{\lambda}x.{e^{x}} &= e^{x} \\
  \overline{\lambda}x.{e^{-x}} &= -e^{-x} \\
  \overline{\lambda}x.x^{\sigma x} &= \sigma x^{\sigma x} \\
  \overline{\lambda}x.x^{-\sigma x} &= -\sigma x^{-\sigma x}
  \end{alignat}
}

So as $\sigma$ varies, so does the flattness of the curve.

\begin{remark}
  Inflection points: in addition to the max and min, we have the
  points at which the second derivative switches from pos. to neg.  In
  other words, the point at which the normal curve starts to flatten.
  This happens when $x=\mu\pm\sigma$.  This makes intuitive sense
  since it is the point at which $\dfrac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}$ is $1$
  (assuming $\mu=0, \sigma=1$), which makes it the place where the
  exponent switches from power to root.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Plot $e^{nx}$ as $n$ varies.  As $n$ decreases, the graph becomes
  flatter; as it increases, it begins to approximate a sharp L shape.
  This is the effect of varying $\sigma$; as it decreases, the
  exponent increases.  Better: plot $e^{\frac{x}{n}}$.
\end{remark}

All of which goes to show, that the normal curve is a kind of
exponential curve, which makes it a kind of growth curve.  It
describes the way error grows as more observations are made.

\chapter{Sampling}

\begin{remark}
  Distinguish between mathematical and empirical usage.  Here we talk
  of carrier sets instead of populations, elements instead of sample
  units, values instead of measurements, etc.

  If we think of sampling clearly, in terms of sets, sequences,
  etc. then the inferential stuff becomes intuitively clear.

\section{Samples}

A sample is a sequence of elements drawn from the carrier set (population).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Sampling Continuous Random Vars}

Discrete v. continuous sampling?  A continuous sample would have to
select ranges rather than elements.  But often we want discrete
sampling of a continuous var; e.g. distance from bullseye.  This would
give us a multiset, but what would the elements and multiplicities be?
E.g. {3[.25]} would mean three events of striking within .25 of the
center.

\begin{remark}
    What we're going to want is counts of number of possible samples,
    number of unique samples (combinations), distribution of samples
    when the sampling sequence is long, distribution of elements in
