	title = {Chance versus Randomness},
	url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/chance-randomness/},
	abstract = {Chance and randomness are closely related. So much so, in fact, thatto say an event happened by chance is near enough synonymous inordinary English with saying it happened randomly. This suggests thatordinary speakers would by and large endorse this {CommonplaceThesis:}, Chance should regulate (that is, it is involved with normsgoverning) rational belief in line with Lewis' Principal Principle(Lewis, 1980), or his New Principle (Lewis, 1994; Hall, 2004). {WhereC} is a reasonable initial credence function, and E isthe evidence, the Principal Principle (omitting some complications) is this:, ({PP)C(p{\textbar}⌜Ch(p)} =x⌝ ∧ E) = x;, Chance should connect with possibility. Leibniz claimed thatprobability was a kind of ‘graded possibility’, and morerecent authors have largely agreed. In particular, it seems clear thatif an outcome has some chance of occurring, then it is possible thatthe outcome occurs. This intuition has been made precise in the Basic Chance Principle ({BCP)} (See supplement A.2 for further details on thisprinciple):, Chance should connect with actual frequencies, at least to theextent of permitting frequencies to be good evidence for the values ofchances. This may be through some direct connection between chance andfrequency, or indirectly through the influence of observed outcomefrequencies on credences about chances via the Principal Principle(Lewis, 1980: 104–6). But chance should not be identified withfrequency—since a fair coin can produce any sequence of outcomes,there is no possibility of identifying chance with observed frequency.(Though of course a fair coin is overwhelmingly likely to produceroughly even numbers of heads and tails when tossed often {enough).Moreover}, there can be a chance for a kind of outcome even when thereare very few instances of the relevant process that leads to thatoutcome, resulting in the actual frequencies being misleading ortrivial (for example, if there is only a single actual {outcome:Hájek} 1997)., When considering the connection between frequency and chance, notjust any frequency will do. What is wanted is the frequency inrelevantly similar trials, with the same kind of experimental {setup.The} relevance of frequencies in such trial is derived from theassumption that in such similar trials, the same chances exist:intra-world duplicate trials should have the same chances. This isclosely related to the ‘stable trial principle’ (Schaffer,2003: 37ff). Chances attach to the outcomes of trials, but the physicalgrounds of the chance lie in the physical properties of the trialdevice or chance setup.,  Theorem 1 (Doob-Wald). The set of random sequences forms a measure one subset of the Cantor space.,  Corollary 1. Every von Mises-random sequence is Borel normal.,  Theorem 2 (Ville). For any countable set of place selections \{φn\}(including the identity), there exists an infinite binarysequence x such that:,  Theorem 3 (Universal Tests and the Existence of Random Sequences). There is a universal testfor {ML-randomness;} moreover, only a measure zero set of infinitebinary sequences fails this test. So almost all such sequences {areML-random.},  Theorem 4 (Kolmogorov). There exists a decompression algorithm whichis near-superior to any other program. Moreover, any such optimalalgorithm is complexity equivalent to any other optimal algorithm (seealso Chaitin 1966 and Martin-Löf 1969a)., Theorem 5. A random sequence of a given length cannot be effectively produced.,  Theorem 6 (Martin-Löf 1966). For any sufficiently long string, there will always be some fairly compressible initial segments. (See also Li and Vitányi 2008:§2.5.1 and Downey {andHirschfeldt} 2010: §2.1.),  Theorem 7 (Schnorr). A sequence  is {ML-random} iff it is prefix-free Kolmogorov random. , {CTa:A} sequence of outcomes happens by chance iff that sequence israndom., One might think that … we can assign probabilities to thevarious possible outcomes. Nothing in the Newtonian physics requires usto assign the probabilities, but we might choose to try to add them forour own conceptual comfort. It can be done as far as the direction ofthe spontaneous motion is concerned. The symmetry of the surface aboutthe apex makes it quite natural for us to add a probabilitydistribution that assigns equal probability to all directions. Thecomplication is that there is no comparable way for us to assignprobabilities for the time of the spontaneous excitation that respectthe physical symmetries of solutions. Those solutions treat allcandidate excitation times T equally. A probabilitydistribution that tries to make each candidate time equally likelycannot be proper—that is, it cannot assign unit probability tothe union of all disjoint outcomes.[22] Or one that is propercan only be defined by inventing extra physical properties, not givenby the physical description of the dome and mass, Newton's laws and thelaws of gravitation, and grafting them unnaturally onto the physicalsystem. (Norton 2003: 9–10), {P2:A} possible sequence of outcomes is random iff a repeatedindeterministic process could produce all of the outcomes.},

	abstract = {The principle of set theory known as the Axiom of Choice hasbeen hailed as “probably the most interesting and, in spite ofits late appearance, the most discussed axiom of mathematics, secondonly to Euclid's axiom of parallels which was introduced more than twothousand years ago” (Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel \& Levy {1973,§II.4).} The fulsomeness of this description might lead thoseunfamiliar with the axiom to expect it to be as startling as, say, {thePrinciple} of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light or the {HeisenbergUncertainty} Principle. But in fact the Axiom of Choice as it isusually stated appears humdrum, even self-evident. For it amounts tonothing more than the claim that, given any collection of mutuallydisjoint nonempty sets, it is possible to assemble a new set — atransversal or choice set — containing exactlyone element from each member of the given collection. Nevertheless,this seemingly innocuous principle has far-reaching mathematicalconsequences — many indispensable, some startling — andhas come to figure prominently in discussions on the foundations ofmathematics. It (or its equivalents) have been employed in countlessmathematical papers, and a number of monographs have been exclusivelydevoted to it., ,   {wac*X:}  ∃f ∈ {2X} [∀x∈ X ∃y ∈ 2φ(x,y) → ∀x {∈X} φ(x,fx)] provided it is provable {inIST} that ∀x[φ(x,0)→ ¬φ(x,1)]},
