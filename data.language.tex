\chapter{The Languages of Data}

\begin{ednote}
Here we briefly survey some of the ``languages'' of data; e.g. R's
idiosyncratic ``factor'' and ``level'', as well as the use of terms
like ``variable'' and ``level'' generally.

The main purpose, however, is to define a more-or-less rigorous
(meta)-language that we will use in this book.  Based on mathematical
and logical notation, possibly type theory.
