Types and ``multiple dispatch'' are ``the core unifying features of
Julia: functions are defined on different combinations of argument
types, and applied by dispatching to the most specific matching
definition.'' \url{http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/introduction/}


``Although it seems a simple concept, multiple dispatch on the types of values is perhaps the single most powerful and central feature of the Julia language.''\url{http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/manual/methods/#id2}
