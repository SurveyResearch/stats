Most introductory texts on stats suck, especially those of the "Stats
for X" variey, where X = Biologists, Economists, Social Scientists,
etc.

This doc, which will probably never be finished, is intended as an
intro to stats that doesn't suck.

These days it is common for writers to answer "What is Statistics" by
saying something along the lines of "data analysis."  This is not so
much false as vacuous.  Unless you already have a pretty good idea of
what stats is, it tells you nothing at best and suggests something
mysterious at worst.

A better answer refers to the etymology of the term and says that
stats is the use of mathematics to characterize states of affairs.
But this too is weak, because it is misleading.  It suggests that
statistics describe facts, ways that the world is.  But that is
generally not the case.

Consider the example of the arithmetic mean.  To say that the average
family has 2.3 children, on this view, is to state a fact, to say
something about the state of the world (or at least the population of
families).  But a little reflection shows that this cannot be.  No
family in the world ever had 2.3 children.  So a sentence like "the
average family has 2.3 children" cannot be referring to a fact about
any real family; the question then is whether it refers to any fact at
all.  And the answer is no.  There is nothing in the world, no fact of
the matter about the population of families, that corresponds to "2.3
children".  The average, "2.3", is a purely mathematical construction,
and mathematical facts are not empirical facts.  The the claim that
the average family has 2.3 children cannot be treated as an empirical
claim; instead, it is a claim about a mathematical abstraction.

But this is counter-intuitive; surely the idea that we can average
over family sizes is unobjectionable.  We know what "family of 2.3
children" means, even it it doesn't refer to a "real" family.  Even if
"2.3 children" is a mathematical abstraction, surely it corresponds
(somehow) to a matter of fact about the population of families.  How
can we explain this?

I think the way to proceed is to treat claims about averages as
counterfactuals.  The claim that "the average family has 2.3 children"
looks like an ordinary factual claim, but in fact it is a
counterfactual claim.  The real claim is that:

    IF every family in the population made the same contribution to
    the total number of children, THEN each family would have 2.3
    children.

This is the intuitive meaning of the formula for the arithmetic mean.
The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers does not express a fact about
that set; instead it expresses what the set would have to be like if
it were uniform, if every element made the same contribution to the
sum.

Stats intros always explain the notion of the mean, but they virtually
never point out its fundamental irreality.
