Generating sample data:

R:  use r<dist>, e.g. rnorm.  help(<dist>) for doc, e.g. help(norm)

Writing sample data to file:

write.table(rnorm(n),file="b.txt")

or

write.csv(rnorm(1000000, 0, 5), file = 'myRandomNumbers.csv', row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

    R's r<dist> becomes <sample>-dist, e.g. rnorm ->  sample-normal

e.g.   (sample-normal 1000 :mean -2 :sd (sqrt 0.5))
